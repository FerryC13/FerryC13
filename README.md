# Brief Introduction

Hi, Everyone. My name is Ferry Chandra. :wave:

Just graduated from [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://sutd.edu.sg/) as a Computer Engineer, I am currently experimenting Flutter and very eager to create android applications with Flutter.

## Interest

I am also learning OutSystems and just want to see the capability of OutSystems as a low code platform.

Outside work, I occasionally run/cycle and play video games. Sometimes, I would read books to pass the time. Not only that, I am also learning Japanese.

**Pronouns**: He/Him ...  
**Fun facts**: Vegetarian, an avid otaku and love emo songs...
